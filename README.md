Great! Your system has a single GPU detected:

- **Vendor:** Intel  
- **Product:** Alder Lake-P GT2 [Iris Xe Graphics]  
- **Driver in use:** i915 (Intel’s open-source Linux kernel driver)  
- **Subsystem:** Samsung Electronics Co Ltd (your laptop manufacturer)  
- **Kernel modules:** i915, xe  

---

## What this means for your Electron / X11 issue

1. **Integrated Intel GPU only:**  
   You do not have a discrete GPU, only the integrated Intel Iris Xe graphics. This is common for ultrabooks like the Galaxy Book 2 Pro.

2. **Driver is i915:**  
   The i915 driver is the standard Intel Linux graphics driver and generally well supported. However, issues can still arise if the driver or X11 configuration is misconfigured or if GPU acceleration in Electron is problematic.

3. **Potential causes of white screen on first click in GodMode browser:**  
   - GPU acceleration conflicts with i915 driver or X11 compositor.  
   - Recent changes you made to GPU settings (e.g., kernel parameters, Xorg config, or switching modes) may have caused instability.  
   - Electron's Chromium GPU sandbox or acceleration may not be fully compatible with your current setup.

---

## Recommendations to troubleshoot and mitigate

### 1. Try launching GodMode with GPU acceleration disabled

Run the GodMode browser (or any Electron app) with these flags to disable GPU acceleration and see if the white screen issue persists:

```bash
godmode --disable-gpu --disable-software-rasterizer
```

Or if you run it via a command line script:

```bash
/path/to/godmode --disable-gpu --disable-software-rasterizer
```

This forces Electron to use CPU rendering instead of GPU, which often resolves rendering issues on problematic GPU setups.

---

### 2. Check X11 compositor/window manager

- Some compositors (like `compton`, `picom`, or certain desktop environments) can cause rendering glitches.
- Try disabling compositor temporarily or switch to a simpler window manager (like `i3` or `openbox`) to test if the issue disappears.

---

### 3. Verify kernel module status

Make sure the i915 module is loaded correctly:

```bash
lsmod | grep i915
```

You should see something like:

```
i915                  1234567  3
drm_kms_helper        123456  1 i915
drm                   123456  4 i915,drm_kms_helper
```

If not loaded or showing errors, you may need to reinstall or update your Intel graphics drivers.

---

### 4. Check Xorg logs for errors

Look at `/var/log/Xorg.0.log` or `~/.local/share/xorg/Xorg.0.log` for any errors or warnings related to i915, GPU acceleration, or Electron.

---

### 5. Reset any recent GPU configuration changes

Since you mentioned you played with GPU settings for another project, consider:

- Reverting any changes to `/etc/X11/xorg.conf` or `/etc/X11/xorg.conf.d/` files.
- Resetting kernel parameters related to graphics (e.g., `nomodeset`, `i915.enable_*` flags).
- Reboot after resetting.

---

## Summary

- Your system uses Intel Iris Xe integrated GPU with the i915 driver.
- The white screen issue in GodMode is likely due to GPU acceleration or X11 compositor conflicts.
- Try disabling GPU acceleration in Electron apps as a first test.
- Check compositor settings and kernel modules.
- Review logs and revert recent GPU configuration changes.

If you want, I can help you create a small script or alias to launch GodMode with GPU acceleration disabled, or assist with checking compositor status and logs. Just ask!

There are no specific reports found in the available sources about the "GodMode" browser from smol-ai exhibiting the exact issue you described—where the X11 interface turns white on the first click, showing only a small menu bar on top and losing all other content. However, some relevant points and context can be provided:

## About GodMode Browser from smol-ai
- GodMode is an open-source AI chat browser built with Electron that allows users to access multiple large language model (LLM) web apps side-by-side in columns, such as ChatGPT, Claude, Bing, Bard, and more, with a single keyboard shortcut. It is designed to show all LLM interfaces simultaneously and supports Linux (including an AppImage), Windows, and macOS[1][2][3][4].
- The browser is Electron-based, which means it uses Chromium and Node.js under the hood, running on top of the system's graphical environment (X11 on Linux).
- The project is actively maintained on GitHub, with issues and feature requests tracked there[6].

## Potential Cause of White Screen Issue on X11
- Your description suggests a graphical or rendering problem under X11 on Kali Linux, especially after changing graphics card settings or configurations.
- Electron apps on Linux using X11 can encounter conflicts or glitches related to GPU acceleration, driver compatibility, or compositor settings, which might cause the window to render as blank or white after interaction.
- It is plausible that modifying graphics card configurations disrupted the X11 environment or GPU acceleration settings, causing Electron's rendering to fail or fallback incorrectly.
- No explicit reports of this exact "white screen after click" bug for GodMode on X11 were found in the GitHub issues or community discussions, but similar Electron app issues on Linux are common when GPU drivers or X11 configurations are altered[6].

## Electron and X11 Conflicts
- Electron apps sometimes have issues with GPU acceleration on Linux/X11, which can be mitigated by launching the app with flags like `--disable-gpu` or `--disable-software-rasterizer`.
- Conflicts can arise if the graphics drivers or X11 compositors are misconfigured or incompatible with Electron's Chromium version.
- Since GodMode is Electron-based, these general Electron+X11 issues likely apply.

## Alternative Browsers Supporting Split Screen / Columns
- GodMode is somewhat unique in being free, open-source, and specialized for showing multiple LLM web apps side-by-side.
- Most other browsers or tools that provide multi-column or tiled tab views are either paid or extensions with limited functionality.
- Some free alternatives or approaches could include:
  - Using tiling window managers on Linux (e.g., i3, Sway) to manually tile multiple browser windows.
  - Browser extensions like "Tile Tabs" for Firefox (free) or "Split Tabs" for Chrome, though these often have limitations or are not as integrated as GodMode.
  - Using open-source Electron-based multi-panel browsers or custom setups, but these are rare.
- There is no well-known free browser exactly like GodMode that natively splits the screen into multiple LLM columns out of the box.

---

### Summary

- No direct reports were found of the GodMode browser turning white on first click under X11 on Kali Linux, but the issue is likely related to Electron's GPU acceleration and X11 graphics configuration, especially after you changed graphics card settings.
- Electron apps on Linux/X11 can have rendering issues if GPU drivers or compositors are misconfigured.
- You might try launching GodMode with GPU acceleration disabled or resetting graphics settings.
- For multi-column browsing of LLMs, GodMode is currently one of the few free, open-source options; other solutions tend to be paid or require manual window tiling.

If you want, I can help you with specific troubleshooting steps for Electron apps on X11 or recommend free tools/extensions for multi-column browsing.
